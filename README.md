# Assembler
USTC ICS HomeWork
## Usage
Package the code into the Assembler.jar. Then use 
```java -jar Assemebler.jar infile```
You will get the .obj file in the same folder as the infile.
## Feature
Support the syntax in Lc3Edit.
But the error message is not perfect.
If there are some syntax errors in the source assembler file, you would get an incorrect .obj file without error notification.
